CHANGES:

May 13th 2008

1.

before: diatonic scale as individual (strong review against this)
now: we subclass types of scales and there are only individuals of scales with tonic. There is not the diatonic scale but a diatonic scale
problem: a major scale or the major scale? the a minor scale gives no problems though. Major scale as a class or as an instance?

2.

before: scales = scale and scale type
now: we distinguish: Set, Scale class hierarchy, Scale individuals. We dont need scale_type anymore
problems: is there any single and good definition of what a scale is? i have doubts about it

3. 

before: disminished and enharmonic
now: diminished and enharmonically equivalent
