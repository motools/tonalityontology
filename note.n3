#we define here a proper OWL description of the concept NOTE according to Peter Westergaard's tonal theory. This is clearly perception oriented more
#than an acoustic description of a signal, which should be an audio features part.

		Formal description of a note. This may be more a resource than any sort of instance as they are real facts which are always different from each other. They are the basic phenomenon for our acoustic and psychological perception. They are indeed events. Notes in a score are symbolic facts which can be clearly defined and are also events within a score but may change in different interpretations of the score.
Do we need to distinguish between a physical note (the signal of it) and the psychological perspective of it? Talking about tonality we should focus on the psychological part and the acoustic should be an audio features part (it is hard to see just one note fact in isolation though).
Is there any way to distinguish between physical event and "mental event"? we may not talk of note as event then...
